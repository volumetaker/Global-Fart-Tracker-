Global Fart Tracker

Welcome to the Global Fart Tracker, a humorous, AI-powered website inspired by the whimsical concept of Fartcoin. This project aims to entertain and inform by estimating the number of farts happening worldwide per second and answering all your fart-related questions through an intelligent chatbot, FartBot.

Project Overview

The Global Fart Tracker is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages, designed to:





Track Farts in Real-Time: Estimate the number of farts occurring globally per second, based on a global population of 8 billion and an average of 15 farts per person per day.



Educate with Fun Facts: Share quirky facts about farts, such as their frequency, composition, and speed.



Answer Fart Questions: Feature FartBot, an AI chatbot that provides witty and knowledgeable answers to any fart-related query.



Engage Users: Include a contact form for feedback and questions (powered by Formspree).

This project is a lighthearted derivative of Fartcoin, a fictional or conceptual cryptocurrency, reimagined as a fun web experience.

Features





Fart Counter: Displays a dynamic estimate of farts per second, updated every 2 seconds with a Â±10% random variation for fun.



Fun Fart Facts: A section with three educational tidbits about farts, presented in a grid layout.



FartBot Chatbot: An interactive AI chatbot that answers fart-related questions with humor and expertise (frontend implemented; backend requires external API integration).



Contact Form: A Formspree-powered form for users to send feedback or inquiries.



Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly layout.
